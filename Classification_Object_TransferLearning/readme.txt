The aim of the project is image classification using transfer learning.
I tried to realize the project using a pre-trained model.
The pre-trained model I use is "InceptionResNetV2". (ImageNet dataset)

More Information about Transfer Learning: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning

The InceptionResNetV2 model consists of 1000 classes.
It was trained with 1,281,167 training images, 50,000 validation and 100,000 test images.
It is also a complex model with 164 layers. It consists of Inception and ResNet architectures. And the accuracy rate is 98.88%
