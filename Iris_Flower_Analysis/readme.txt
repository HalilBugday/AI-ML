The aim of the project is to reduce the 4-dimensional feature of the Iris flower in the data set to 2 dimensions. The aim is to make them identifiable without losing the distinctive features of the flower.


Our dataset is the Iris dataset, one of the most popular datasets in the field of artificial learning.
