This project is coded as a recommendation system. According to research, recommendation systems have been observed to increase the revenue of any company by 10% to 25%. There are 2 different systems:

1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering
2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

In the project, I used the Item-Based one, which is generally the most preferred (depending on the situation).

Two data sets were used:
1. Information of movies
2. User information
