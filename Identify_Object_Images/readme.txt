The aim of the project is to analyze photos using Deep Learning Algorithms.
Identifying and classifying objects. CIFAR-10 data set was used in this study.
The data consists of 60000 photographs with dimensions of 32x32 pixels.
Additionally, there are 10 different classes in the data set. (Actually vehicles and animals, like cats and birds, cars, frogs, ships)
In the project, I used CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), one of the most important Algorithms of deep learning applications. Additionally, the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) algorithm is also included in this project.
