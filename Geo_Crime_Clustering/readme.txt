The aim of the project is a San Francisco dataset consisting of map-based information, the aim of which is to make a geographical clustering. 

Although there are many statistical details about crimes in the data set, I only used latitude and longitude in the project. Since I only work on numerical values, I used K-means Machine learning algorithm. Additionally, the OpenStreetMap geographical positioning system was used in the project. And finally, I transferred the resulting geographical map to an HTML file so that I could use it on a web page.


NOTE: Please contact me for the dataset.
