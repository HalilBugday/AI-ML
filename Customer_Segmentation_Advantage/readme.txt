NOTE!: Please first take a look at the "Customer_Segmentation" project in other projects.

K-means was used in the previous "Customer_Segmentation" project. However, since the data set in this project was more complete and had categorical values, I tried a different approach.

Thanks to the k-modes algorithm developed by MIT, I worked on both numerical and categorical values for cluster.
