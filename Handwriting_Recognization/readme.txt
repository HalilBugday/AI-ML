In this study, a machine learning model that can identify any handwriting has been coded. Two machine learning models were used in this study. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Logistic Regression. 

The data set consists of handwritten photographs and is divided into approximately 60000 for training and 10000 for testing. And it consists only of numbers (0 to 9). These 28x28 pixel photographs constitute 784 features.
